The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog while a heavy rain falls. Beyond the bright, azure clouds, things look quite different than they do from the Earth’s surface. Young children often ask why the sky is blue, yet few people mention the thin layer of ozone that protects us. It is a strange world, full of joy and sorrow, where every voice should be heard clearly and with great care. Please judge my speech by the rhythm and the flow of these few short lines.
